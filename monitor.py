Onion Site Query Monitor

This script periodically checks a list of Onion site URLs and performs user research queries using Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.
If the specified query string is found on any site or search engine results, it sends a notification to a Telegram chat and logs the result in a CSV file.
It uses Selenium for web scraping and integrates with Telegram for notifications.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- requests
- selenium
